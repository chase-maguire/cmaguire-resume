            <p class="otherText">This is a fully dynamic character sheet that works with the Dark Heresey Second Edition system made with html, css, and javascript.
                I made this during my time learning html, css, and javascript during January of 2024.
                Currently a work in progress, every feature is functional apart from saving and loading.
                I am currently making my own table top role play game universe and once it is complete, my friend group will use this sheet for our characters.
                I think it will also be fun to expand this into non-playable character sheets and vehicle sheets.
                The two links at the top titled "DH2e Quick Reference" and "Character Creator" are not created by me.
                Instead, they are references I found online that my friends and I can use while we play the game.</p>
